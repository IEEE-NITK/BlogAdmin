# Hackathon 1

An introduction to Python and its inbuilt libraries 

## Book Analyzer (Python Scripting)

* Read in Lord of the Rings as an enormous string using os and with statements, then use re to count occurrences of common words or letters. Print statistics about the frequencies and see if they follow to Zipfâ€™s Law.

### About Zipf's Law

> Zipf's law states that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation. For example, in the Brown Corpus of American English text, the word "the" is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word "of" accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by "and" (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.[4]

Your task is to store all the words in some Python Data Structure like a map and print out the following information to a CSV File.

|Rank|Word|Times Occurred|Frequency %|
|----|----|--------------|-----------|
|	1|    |  			 |			 |
|	2|    |  			 |			 |
|	3|    |  			 |			 |
|	4|    |  			 |			 |
|	5|    |  			 |			 |
|	6|    |  			 |			 |
|	7|    |  			 |			 |
|	8|    |  			 |			 |
|	9|    |  			 |			 |
|  10|    |  			 |			 |

### Libraries to use:
* statistics
* os 
* csv

Apart from all of this try to make your code as readable as possible and keep documenting code.
